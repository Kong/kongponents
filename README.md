Kongponents is a Vue component library of frequently needed UI elements. They were developed to solve [Kong](https://konghq.com)'s application needs, but are generic enough to use in any web application.

The Kongponents repo is a monorepo, managed by [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) that is composed of many [npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com/org/kongponents).

## Documentation
[Kongponents Docs](https://kongponents.konghq.com) are powered by VuePress and the source can be viewed [here](docs/README.md).
