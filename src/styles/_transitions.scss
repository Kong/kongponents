/* 
Kongponents Transitions 

Styles for transitions using Vue native <Transition> component.
You don't need to import this file directly, it is imported by styles.scss, therefore it is included in the build.

All transitions names must follow `kongponents-<name>-transition` pattern to avoid any conflicts with styles defined by the consuming apps.
