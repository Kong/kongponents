# Migrating to version `9`

This guide is primarily for users of Kongponents `v8` who want to browse the breaking changes they may encounter when upgrading to Kongponents `v9`.

This is not something you have to read from top to bottom before trying out the new version.

If you notice any breaking changes we missed, we invite you to [open an issue](https://github.com/Kong/kongponents/issues).
